# pySnake
Terminal based Snake game built on Python.

First game built using Python with nothing but the terminal.
I soft coded the variables found in the constant variables below classes.

Snake doesn't destroy on map edge crossing or if it touches it's own body. 
Apples are shown as @'s and give extra body length to the snake.

Running game.py on windows 10:
1. Python 3.8.2 installed
2. game.py file is somewhere on computer (like desktop)
3. Open cmd.exe (cd to game.py file directory, C:\Users\(username)\Desktop)
4. Type 'python game.py' to run.
5. Start playing
